INSTALLATION:
=============
I recommend using my vim-addon-manager.
You can also put the top directory of this pluign and its dependencies into a
&runtime path (see vim-nix-addon-info.txt)

FEATURES:
=========

- quick mappings to nix-instantiate .nix files. You can teach the .nix language
  yourself or run tests easily.
- gf mapping to jump to import files (automatically finding the default.nix)
  or proposing to create those files
- some snippets which can be used with snipMate plugin
- folding for all-packages.nix (by ### lines)
- settings stuff such as indentation characters tec

SETUP:
======

put into your .vimrc:

" this will define the correct maintainers line in meta tags:
let g:nix_maintainer="YOURNAME"


TIP:
Use a mapping like this to open all-packages.nix.
It picks all-packages.nix of the current nixpkgs top level directory.
If that doesn't exist NIXPKGS_ALL is used to find all-packages.nix
noremap \aps : if filereadable('pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix') <bar> e pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix <bar> else <bar> exec 'e '.expand("$NIXPKGS_ALL") <bar> endif<cr>

TODO:
=====
fix syntax and move the file into this repository (-> vim_configurable expression)

historical note: some code was taken from my tovl into this repository
